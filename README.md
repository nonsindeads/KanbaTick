# KanbaTick
My goal is to **write a web application** that combines the simplicity of a kanban board with a ticket system, documentation and other useful features.

One of the **most important points** for me personally is in this project:
Further education and my professional future

I work as a system administrator myself with a team of 5 colleagues and am a trained IT specialist for application developers. During my work as an administrator I have tried many tools, but have not yet found anything that meets my requirements. At least not **without incurring horrendous costs** or bringing along tons of **unnecessary functions**.

My final goal is an **OpenSource project** with premium support in terms of customization and integration or connection to existing systems.

## I do not program like everybody else.
**You don't have to reinvent the wheel, but I often find it not bad to invent my own wheel!**
